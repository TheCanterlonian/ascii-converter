# Instructions:
generates the input file (named "file.txt") at startup.
put your ascii art in there and it will be converted and
then the converted form will be printed to the screen in
a console window the next time it is run.
The file itself will not be altered.
# Gonna be honest
wrote this while i was stoned but...
it is useful for console game dev, so
i will be keeping it up here.
might rewrite it in C at some point.
it's a bit strange to need dotnet just
to run a string manipulator.
